Why hospitalized patients have a higher death rate in COVID19 outbreak? Does pre-screening help reducing the death?

COVID19 outbreak has already deprived nearly 10,000 people’s lives in U.S.. Therefore, being able to find a way to prevent this infectious disease and appropriate way for treatment is very essential. Hospital is always the first-place patients seeking for medical help, especially during the pandemic. But is hospital really a good place at this time? Data shows the death rate for those confirmed with COVID19 and hospitalized is over 30 times higher than those not being hospitalized.  So, what’s the better solution, staying home or seeking help in hospital? Is pre-screening really helping reducing the death rate? If being confirmed with COVID19, what’s the survival rate based on the patient’s medical history?

The first part of the project involves exploring the reason why hospitalized patients are more likely to die, and discussing whether pre-screening would lower the death rate.
